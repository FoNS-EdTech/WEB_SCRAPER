Scraping tables

So, most likely we will discuss this in our 1 2 1 or tools meeting BUT basically what I wanted to highlight is that for the GRADE CENTRE situation this 
code appears before the table id:
                <div id="#nonAccessibleTableDiv" class>
                <!-- skeleton table for non-accessible mode -->
               
This doesn't appear for any other table around the internet(or at least for the one which I included in this repository for you to see how it looks like
        after I convert it to a .csv file)...not even Turnitin so that may be why you were able to download the Turnitin table, cause the Inspect from Turnitin doesn't have this
        Skeleton item.....
